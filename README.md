# Bitmap-Maker
Just a quick, simple python program built on my pygame-pygame_gui framework to convert bitmap images into an array of hexadecimal numbers.


Press c or r to clear, and press the convert button or press enter to convert. It prints the output to the terminal, and copies it to your clipboard. Dragging [mostly] works.
